= Above All Compassion

This is an (very unfortunately) failed Ruby on Rails project. It was intended to
be an online store. Unfortunately, the company that asked me to build this,
decided to discontinue the whole idea.

This was all very unfortunate. However, I am somewhat proud of the work I did
for this store:

1. It is my first real Rails project
2. It has just about 100% test code coverage.
3. It uses a somewhat custom authentication scheme.
4. It was lots of work, and I learned a lot!

== See it in action.

Unfortunately, it is currently not deployed anywhere. It can be checked out and
set up like any rails project. The database config right now points to MySQL,
but it is easy enough to switch to SQLite. That is the only main change that
would have to be done to get it running in a local environment.
